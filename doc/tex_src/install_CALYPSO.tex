\section{Installation}


\subsection{Compiler Requirements}
Most of source code of Calypso are written in Fortran2003. Consequently, Fortran compiler with supporting fortran 2003 is required. We can obtain a number of information about Fortran from \url{http://fortranwiki.org/}, and you can also find a table of the supported features of Fortran 2003 standard at \url{http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Fortran+2003+status}. In addition, C compiler is optionally required to us zlib support for compressed data IO. 

GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection (\url{https://gcc.gnu.org}) includes gfortran compiler in the most of Linux distributions. For MacOS, any fortran compiler needs to be installed because Xcode does not have fortran compiler. The easiest way is installing GCC by using a package manager such as macports (\url{https://www.macports.org}) or homebrew (\url{https://brew.sh/index}).


\subsection{Library Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
Calypso requires the following libraries.
\begin{itemize}
\item GNU make
\item MPI libraries (OpenMPI, MPICH, etc)
\item FFTPACK Ver 5.1D (\url{https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/fftpack5.1d/fftpack5.1d.html}). The source files for FFTPACK are included in {\tt src/EXTERNAL\_libs} directory.
\end{itemize}
Linux and Max OS X use GNU make as a default 'make' command, but some system (e.g. BSD or SOLARIS) does not use GNU make as default. \verb|configure| command searches and set correct GNU make command. MPI library such as OpenMPI (\url{https://www.open-mpi.org}) or MPICH (\url{https://www.mpich.org}) can be installed by the most of package manager.

In addition, the following environment and libraries can be used (optional).
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenMP 
\item BLAS
\item zlib (https://www.zlib.net)
\item FFTW version 3 (\url{http://www.fftw.org}) including Fortran wrapper
\item PARALLEL HDF5 (\url{https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/PHDF5})  including Fortran wrapper.
\end{itemize}
Note: Calypso does NOT use MPI and OpenMP features in FFTW3. 

In the most of platforms, the Fourier transform by FFTW is faster than that by FFTPACK. 

Zlib is used for compressed data IO. Zlib is installed in most of UNIX platforms.

HDF5 is used for field data output with XDMF format instead of VTK format. The comparison of field data format is described in section ref{sec:VTK}. 

OpenMP is used for the parallelization under the shared memory. Better choice to use both MPI and OpenMP parallelization (so-called Hybrid parallelization) or only using MPI (so-called flat MPI) is depends on the computational platform and compiler. For example, flat MPI has much better performance on Linux cluster with Intel Xeon processors and with Intel fortran compiler, but Hybrid model has better performance on Hitachi SR24000 with Power 8 processors.

\subsection{Known problems}
\subsubsection*{FFTPACK and Intel compiler}
FFTPACK fails to compile with Intel fortran using the {\tt `-warn all'} option. Currently the {\tt `-warn all'} option is excluded by Makefile when FFTPACK is compiled.

\subsubsection*{Homebrew's FFTW3 on Mac OS X}
Calypso uses Fortran wrappers in FFTW3. If FFTW3 is installed using Homebrew for Mac OS X (\url{http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/}), the required fortran wrappers are not installed. In this case, please install FFTW3 with Fortran wrappers with another package manager (Macports (\url{http://www.macports.org}, for example), build FFTW3 by yourself including the Fortran wrapper, or turn off FFTW3 features in Calypso.

\subsubsection*{XL fortran}
In XL fortran, preprocessor options is not specified by \verb|-D...|, but \verb|-Wf, '-D...'|. Please edit preprocessor macro option \verb|F90CPPFLAGS| in \verb|work/Makefile| by an editor.

\subsubsection*{Cross compiler support}
{\tt configure} command in Calypso does not support cross compilation. If you want to compile with a cross compiler, please set the variables in Makefile manually (see section \ref{section:no_configure})

\subsection{Directories}

The top directory of Calypso (ex. \verb|[CALYPSO_HOME]|) contains the following directories.
\begin{verbatim}
% cd [CALYPSO_HOME]
% ls
CMakeLists.txt	Makefile.in	configure.in	examples
INSTALL		bin		doc		src
LICENSE		configure	doxygen		work

\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item{\verb bin:      } directory for executable files
\item{\verb cmake:    } directory for cmake configurations
\item{\verb cmake:    } directory for document generated by doxygen
\item{\verb doc:      } documentations
\item{\verb examples: } examples
\item{\verb src:      } source files
\item{\verb work:     } work directory. Compile is done in this directory.
\end{description}

\subsection{Doxygen}
Doxygen (\url{http://www.doxygen.org}) is an powerful document generation tool from source files. We only save a configuration file in this directory because thousands of html files generated by doxygen. The documents for source codes are generated by the following command:
% 
\begin{verbatim}
% cd [CALYPSO_HOME]/doxygen
% doxygen ./Doxyfile_CALYPSO
\end{verbatim}
%
The html documents can see by opening \verb|[CALYPSO_HOME]/doxygen/html/index.html|.  Automatically generated documentation is also available on the CIG website at \url{http://www.geodynamics.org/cig/software/calypso/}.

\subsection{Install using {\tt configure} command }
\subsubsection{Configuration using {\tt configure} command }
Calypso uses the configure script for configuration to install. The simplest way to install programs is the following process in the top directory of Calypso.
% 
\begin{verbatim}
%pwd
[CALYPSO_HOME]
% ./configure
...
% make
...
% make install
\end{verbatim}
%
After the installation, object modules can be deleted by the following command;
% 
\begin{verbatim}
% make clean
\end{verbatim}
%

{./configure} generates a Makefile in the current directory.  Available options for {\tt configure} can be checked using the {\tt ./configure --help} command. The following options are available in the {\tt configure} command.
%
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
Optional Features:
  --disable-option-checking  ignore unrecognized --enable/--with options
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --enable-fftw3          Use fftw3 library 
 Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --with-hdf5=yes/no/PATH full path of h5pcc for parallel HDF5 configuration
  --with-blas=<lib>       use BLAS library <lib>
  --with-zlib=DIR root directory path of zlib installation defaults to
                    /usr/local or /usr if not found in /usr/local
  --without-zlib to disable zlib usage completely

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  FC          Fortran compiler command
  FCFLAGS     Fortran compiler flags
  MPICC       MPI C compiler command
  MPIFC       MPI Fortran compiler command
  PKG_CONFIG  path to pkg-config utility
  CPP         C preprocessor
  FFTW3_CFLAGS
              C compiler flags for FFTW3, overriding pkg-config
  FFTW3_LIBS  linker flags for FFTW3, overriding pkg-config

\end{verbatim}
}
%
An example of usage of the configure command is the following;
\begin{verbatim}
% ./configure --prefix='/Users/matsui/local' \
? CFLAGS='-O -Wall -g' FCFLAGS='-O -Wall -g' \
? PKG_CONFIG_PATH='/Users/matsui/local/lib/pkgconfig' \
? --with-blas=yes --enable-fftw3 --with-zlib=/usr/local \
? --with-hdf5='/Users/matsui/local/bin/h5pcc'

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Compile}
Compile is performed using the {\tt make} command. The Makefile in the top directory is used to generate another Makefile in the {\tt work} directory, which is automatically used to complete the compilation. The object file and libraries are compiled in the {\tt work} directory. Finally, the executive files are assembled in {\tt bin} directory. You should find the following programs in the {\tt bin} directory.
%
\begin{description}
\item{\verb gen_sph_grids:    }\\
 Preprocessing program for data transfer for spherical harmonics transform
\item{\verb check_sph_grids:    }\\

\end{description}
%
The following library files are also made in {\tt work} directory.
%
\begin{description}
\item{\verb libcalypso.a:    } Calypso library
\item{\verb libcalypso_c.a:    } Calypso library from C sources
\item{\verb libfftpack.5d.a: } FFTPACK 5.1 library
\end{description}
%

\subsubsection{Clean}
The object and fortran module files in {\tt work} directory is deleted by typing
\begin{verbatim}
% make clean
\end{verbatim}
This command deletes files with the extension {\tt .o}, {\tt .mod}, {\tt .par}, {\tt .diag}, and {\tt ~}.

\subsubsection{Distclean}
To revert the files and directory to the original package, use make distclean as
\begin{verbatim}
% make distclean
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Install}
 The executive files are copied to the install directory \verb|$(INSTDIR)/bin|. The install directory \verb|$(INSTDIR)| is defined in Makefile, and can also set by  \verb|${--prefix}| option for \verb|configure| command. Alternatively, you can use the programs in \verb|${SRCDIR}/bin| directory without running \verb|make install|. If directory \verb|${PREFIX}| does not exist, \verb|make install | creates  \verb|${PREFIX}|,  \verb|${PREFIX}/lib|,  \verb|${PREFIX}/bin|, and  \verb|${PREFIX}/include| directories. No files are installed in \verb|${PREFIX}/lib| and \verb|${PREFIX}/include|.

\subsubsection{Construct dependecies (only for developper)}
Fortran90 routines need to be build after modules which are used in the routines. C source files also need dependency among include files. Consequently, list of dependency of source files are saved in the file \verb|Makefile.depends| in each directory. When you modify the source files with changing the module usage,  \verb|Makefile.depends| files need to be updated. To update the  \verb|Makefile.depends|files, use the  \verb|make| command at the \verb|[CALYPSO_HOME]| directory as \\
%
\begin{verbatim}
% make depends
\end{verbatim}

This process generate dependencies of the Fortran modules by program \verb|make_f90depends|. For C source files, the dependency is generated by the gcc with \verb|-MM -w -DDEPENDENCY_CHECK| option. Consequently, the dependencies need to be generated by the environment with gcc or compatible compiler. After generating the dependency, you can transfer the modified package and build without using gcc.

\subsection{Install without using configure}
\label{section:no_configure}
It is possible to compile Calypso without using the \verb|configure| command. To do this, you need to edit the \verb|Makefile|. First, copy \verb|Makefile| from template \verb|Makefile.in| as
%
\begin{verbatim}
% cp Makefile.in Makefile
\end{verbatim}
In Makefile, the following variables should be defined.
%
\begin{description}

\subsection{Install using cmake}
CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system. CMake can be downloaded from \url{http://www.cmake.org}. The following procedure is required to install.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create working directory (you can also use \verb|[CALYPSO_HOME]/work|).
\item Generate Makefile and working directories by {\tt cmake} command.
\item Compile programs by {\tt make} command.
\end{enumerate}
%
In this section, \verb|[CALYPSO\_HOME]/work| is used as the working directory.
